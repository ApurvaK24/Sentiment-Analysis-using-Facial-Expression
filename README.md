# Sentiment-Analysis-using-Facial-Expression
Enhancing student engagement and involvement in the classroom is a key factor in optimizing the learning process. The quality of student learning and their active participation is closely linked to their cognitive state. A prospective future scope involves the real-time analysis of students' facial expressions, which can offer insights into their current psychology. By promptly assessing students and learning the behavioural patterns within the classroom, the future scope involves using this data for conducting sentiment analysis. This would provide a good understanding of students' emotional states and facilitate academic adjustments accordingly. Students' sentiments can be analyzed based on their factors, Facial expression - Used to analyze the state of mind of the student Responsiveness- How the students respond in class to teachers, so that we can understand much is their understanding capacity. Attentiveness- Judging the overall behaviour of students in class so as to understand how much they pay attention in class. Thus, this will improve students’ learning experiences according to their understanding. Our model will focus on students’ evaluation based on their attentiveness in class. Depending upon it, we would be able to generate a heatmap of students' attentiveness. By analyzing it the teachers can accordingly schedule their lectures and evaluate them accordingly, which will be beneficial in the learning process and thus scheduling a timetable based on what time students will be more attentive to subjects.
# Image Description and databases
•	Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for Image Classification, Semantic Segmentation, Face and Emotion Recognition. <br />
Image Database: <br />
•	FER2013: The Facial Expression Recognition 2013 (FER2013) dataset is a widely used dataset for facial emotion recognition. It contains over 35,000 images categorized into seven different emotions. You can search for this dataset online to find its official source. 
•	AffectNet: AffectNet is a large-scale dataset with labelled facial expressions. It includes over one million facial images with a wide range of emotions and intensities.
# Problem Definition
The proposed work, named CSSAFE (Classroom Student Sentiment Analysis using Facial Expressions), aims to address the challenges in school scheduling and student engagement assessment by utilizing advanced technology for real-time analysis of students' facial expressions during classroom sessions. The primary objective is to enhance the learning experience by optimizing class schedules based on peak student engagement. The system incorporates a unique "concentration metric" to evaluate attendance, considering students' engagement levels. It seeks to provide educators with valuable insights into students' attentiveness and emotional states, ultimately leading to more interactive and engaging classroom environments.
#Scope
1. Real-Time Analysis: The system will utilize Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for image recognition, semantic segmentation, face and emotion recognition to perform real-time analysis of students' facial expressions.<br />

2. Data Sources: The project will rely on datasets such as FER2013, which contains over 35,000 images categorized into seven emotions, and AffectNet, a large-scale dataset with labelled facial expressions.<br />

3. Emotion Recognition: The model will employ CNNs for emotion recognition, classifying emotions such as joy, surprise, sadness, anger, disgust, fear, and contempt based on facial expressions.<br />

4. Concentration Metrics: The system will generate concentration metrics to evaluate students' attentiveness. These metrics will include high, medium, and low concentration levels, which can help educators understand how attentive students are during different parts of a class.<br />

5. Real-Time Implementation: The proposed work aims to provide real-time analysis of students' emotions and concentration levels, enabling educators to make immediate adjustments to their teaching methods and schedules.<br />
